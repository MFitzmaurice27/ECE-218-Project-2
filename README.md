# Engine and Headlights control systems
Michael Fitzmaurice and Konstantinos Tzimpilis

## System Behavior
This system controls the engine and headlights systems in a car for the purposes of safety for new drivers. The car will only allow the engine to be turned on if the passenger and driver are both seated with seatbelts fastened. The headlights have three modes, ON, OFF, and AUTO. These modes are controlled with the driver by use of a dial. When set to ON or OFF, the headlights will be permanently set to that repective state, while in AUTO, the headlights will only be ON when a lack of light is sensed, and OFF otherwise.

## Summary of Testing Results
The testing of this system ended up being completely successful.
